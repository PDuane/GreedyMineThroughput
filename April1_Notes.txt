For next week:
    Implement fine-resolution algorithm and run
    Start planning robot movement and obstacle observation

Greedy algorithm for fully-known environment with no blockage
    So far, more realistic in terms of throughput
    Goal: maximize total throughput
        Show that original algorithm does not optimize for throughput

Benchmark 1:
    Use original greedy algorithm work to benchmark current work

Benchmark 2:
    Number of pixel (finer resolution) down the tunnel
    Use full raytracing algorithm

Implement unknown obstacle locations
    Make robot move from one node drop location to another
    As it moves, it will see obstacles and update map
        Assume obstacles are rectangular
    Add observation map
